### Updated to **1.20.3**
* Added **Gingham Wools** & **Gingham Carpets**
* Changed tuff set textures
  * Backported 1.21 polished tuff & tuff bricks textures

If you use the 1.21 experimental toggle, both modded & 1.21 Polished Tuff & Tuff Bricks will be present, 
but due to a compatibility problem, only one of the two will be craftable.
The modded ones will be removed at 1.21 release.
